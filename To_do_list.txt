Okay, I might have been on the wrong track all these time. >_<
Don't have enough time anymore. >_<


To do list:
-Decide which predictors we want
	-> Currently I'm thinking of every column in build_auth_m216 + date(pretend we don't know it's insignificant)
		+ average transaction amount
- Filter number of merchants
	-> Like, get rid of some insignificant transactions. We don't want that. (Open for any ideas if you guys can
		do it more efficiently)
	-> Best is to run on individual super industry and then individual industry (George's idea, which is actually a
		good idea now I think about it.)
	-> Choose the most significant ones
	-> I've included the code, just run change the name and predictors accordingly
- Calculate the frequency of each customer uses credit card on merchants
	-> In fact, this would be used to calculate the transaction rate for the do_offer_coupon
- Run an analysis on the remaining predictors
	-> I'm working on this all night but had been on the wrong track ):
	-> Hopefully I can figure out by tomorrow morining. ):
- Using the result of the analysis we have to come up with a linear function that yields est_amt_trxn for do_offer_coupon
- Slides.........
	-> I definitely don't know how to do this
